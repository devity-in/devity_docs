# Security Design and Considerations

Security is paramount in a system like Devity that dynamically controls application UI and potentially interacts with sensitive data and backend APIs. This document outlines key security considerations and design principles.

## 1. Authentication & Authorization

### 1.1 Web Console Access

*   **Authentication:** Users (Developers, Designers, PMs) must authenticate securely to access the Web Console. Standard methods like email/password (with proper hashing), SSO (e.g., Google, SAML) should be supported.
*   **Authorization (RBAC):** Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within the Console.
    *   Define roles (e.g., Admin, Editor, Viewer).
    *   Assign permissions to roles (e.g., create/edit specs, approve publishing, manage users, view analytics).
    *   Assign users to roles, potentially on a per-project or per-team basis.

### 1.2 Backend API Access

*   **Console-to-Backend:** APIs used by the Web Console must be protected. Session management (e.g., secure cookies, JWT tokens) should be used after user login.
*   **SDK-to-Backend (Debug/Direct Mode):** If the SDK communicates directly with the backend (e.g., for debug spec fetching), this channel needs secure authentication. API Keys (`apiKey` provided during SDK initialization) are a common approach. Keys must be securely managed and potentially scoped.
*   **API Key Security:** API Keys used by the SDK should be treated as sensitive credentials. Avoid hardcoding them directly in client code where possible (use build configurations, secure storage). Consider key rotation capabilities.

### 1.3 Action-Triggered API Calls (`ApiCall` Action)

*   **Authentication Forwarding:** Decide how authentication is handled for API calls triggered via the `ApiCall` action *from the Client SDK* to *your application's backend*.
    *   **Option 1 (Recommended):** The SDK makes calls to *your* backend, which already has the user's authentication context (e.g., session token). The `ApiCall` action might only specify the relative path and method.
    *   **Option 2 (Less Secure):** The Spec includes sensitive tokens/credentials to be passed in headers. This is generally discouraged as it embeds secrets in the potentially cacheable Spec JSON.
    *   **Option 3:** The Devity backend proxies calls (adds complexity and potential bottleneck).
*   **Authorization:** Your application backend remains responsible for authorizing API calls initiated via SDUI, just like any other client request.

## 2. Spec Security

### 2.1 Secure Delivery (CDN)

*   Use HTTPS for all communication (Console-Backend, Backend-CDN, SDK-CDN, SDK-Backend).
*   Configure CDN appropriately (e.g., restrict access methods, potentially use signed URLs if needed, though often API key validation on SDK side is sufficient).

### 2.2 Preventing Malicious Specs

*   **Input Validation:** The Backend must rigorously validate all data coming from the Web Console before storing or publishing Specs. Prevent injection of malicious scripts or unexpected structures.
*   **Sandboxing (SDK):** The SDK acts as a sandbox.
    *   It should only interpret known, registered Renderers, Widgets, and Actions.
    *   It should limit the scope of what Actions can do (e.g., prevent arbitrary code execution).
    *   Custom Actions/Widgets are the responsibility of the app developer but should be registered carefully.
*   **Expression Engine Security:** The expression engine used by the SDK must be secure against executing arbitrary code or accessing unintended system resources.
*   **`ApiCall` Security:** Limit the scope of `ApiCall`. Avoid allowing Specs to call arbitrary external URLs if possible; ideally, calls should target pre-approved domains or only the application's own backend.

## 3. Data Security & Privacy

*   **Sensitive Data Handling:** Avoid storing sensitive user data directly within Specs whenever possible. Fetch required data dynamically via secure API calls.
*   **Data Minimization:** Only include necessary data bindings and parameters in Specs and Actions.
*   **Compliance:** Consider relevant data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) in how data is handled and logged.

## 4. Auditing & Monitoring

*   **Audit Logs:** The Backend should maintain audit logs for critical actions: user logins, Spec creation/modification/publishing, role changes, etc.
*   **Monitoring:** Monitor system health, API usage, CDN traffic, and potential security events.

## 5. Best Practices

*   Regularly update dependencies (Backend, Console, SDK) to patch vulnerabilities.
*   Perform security reviews and penetration testing.
*   Follow secure coding practices across all components.
*   Educate users (console users, developers) on security best practices (e.g., API key management).
